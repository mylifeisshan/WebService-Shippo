0.0.9     2015-10-24 23:41:44+01:00 Europe/London
    - A reasonable minimum set of test finished. There can always be more
      tests and there will be in the future. At 96.1% coverage (local), 93%
      (Github), I'm now going to get some documentation done.
0.0.8     2015-10-24 16:16:29+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.
    - Entities with asynchronous work-flows stable.
    - More tests.
    - More refactoring.
0.0.7     2015-10-20 20:00:55+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (no more until the 23rd when I return home).
    - More core tests added for Rate and Shipment entities.
    - Most of the important user-facing methods take blocking callbacks.
    - A metric ton of re-factoring.
    - And a partridge in a pear tree.
0.0.6     2015-10-19 23:34:42+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (reasonably stable)
    - More tests added
    - Lots of re-factoring (particularly of test code)

0.0.5     2015-10-19 20:16:14+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (reasonably stable).
    - More tests added.
    - Lots and lots of re-factoring.

    - Interim release.

0.0.3     2015-10-16 17:55:27+01:00 Europe/London

0.0.2     2015-10-16 01:07:52+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.
    - API appears functional. Cruddy developer tests will now be built-out
      into something more useful and robust. Naturally, documentation is
      going to be forthcoming, too.
    
0.0.1     2015-10-15 14:30:34+01:00 Europe/London
    - Initial version.
