# WebService-Shippo
A Shippo Perl API wrapper

##Oct 16, 2015

Pretty much code-complete. Maybe some more re-factoring, but it's actually
looking ok. All API entity operations seem to work. But I should now build
out a decent test suite from my crappy developer tests.

Will begin to look over the API docs some more to see what improvements, if
any, should be made to this wrapper.

Still need to implement 'rates' action for Shipments, and make the 
ReturnShipments work.

Very rough, very early progress. Expecting to have a draft out in a couple of
days.
