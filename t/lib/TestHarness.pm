# * dump ( LIST )
#   Parameters:
#       LIST - the list of items you want dumped.
#   Return Value:
#       STRING - Data::Dumper::Concise rendition of LIST.
#
# Dumps data in a human-readable format.

# * __TEST__
#   Return Value:
#       STRING - the name of the test currently being executed.
# * __TEST__ (LIST)
#   Parameters:
#       LIST - list of comments that will appear after the name of the test
#           currently being executed.
#   Return Value:
#       STRING - the name of the test currently being executed, together
#           with the comments passed. A colon (:) separates the test's name
#           from the comments.

# * __STASH__
#   Return Value:
#       HASHREF - the structure used by the test as a medium for sharing
#           data with other tests in the same test sequence.
# * __STASH__ (KEY-NAME)
#   Parameters:
#       KEY-NAME - the name of the key for which the value is sought.
#   Return Value:
#       SCALAR - the value associated with the key name.
# * __STASH__ (KEY-VALUES)
#   Parameters:
#       KEY-VALUES - a list of key/value pairs that should be set in the
#           stash.
#   Return Value:
#       HASHREF - the structure used by the test as a medium for sharing
#           data with other tests in the same test sequence.
#
# A place to share data among tests in the same sequence. The "__STASH__"
# symbol also has an alias called "stash".

# * INVOCANT->run_tests (TESTS)
# * INVOCANT->run_tests (TESTS, PARENT-NAME, PARENT-STASH)
#   Arguments:
#       TESTS - reference to a array (the test sequence) defined as a list
#           of key/value pairs for which the key is a test's name and the
#           value is a code reference (a test) or an array (another test
#           sequence). Due to their sequential nature test sequences are
#           expressed as arrays instead of hashes.
#       PARENT-NAME - the name of the test that defined this test sequence,
#           usually set by "run_tests" on a recursive call for nested test
#           sequences and combined with the current test's name.
#       PARENT-STASH - the stash used by the test that defined this test
#           sequence, usually set by "run_tests" on a recursive call for
#           nested test sequences and comined with the current test's stash.
#   Return Value:
#       INVOCANT - the same entity used to invoke the method.
#
# Executes a sequence of tests.
