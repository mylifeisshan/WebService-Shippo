=head1 NAME

WebService::Shippo::CarrierAccount - Shippo Manifest class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Manifests are close-outs of shipping labels of a certain day. Some carriers
require manifests to properly process the shipments.

The following carriers require manifests:

=over 2

=item * DHL Express purchased through Shippo

If you use Shippo's DHL Express rates, you need to manifest ("close-out")
your shipments each day before submitting them to the carrier. If you don't
close-out a shipment, it might not be processed at all by DHL Express.

=item * USPS scan form

The USPS allows you to create "scan forms", which also is a Manifest. By
creating scan forms, the USPS doesn't need to scan each of your packages
individually and all tracking codes are updated immediately.

=item * Canada Post Contract customers

Contract customers that generally ship more than 50 shipments a day will
need to create manifests to transmit the shipments for billing, for a
given day. Contract customers that ship less than 50 daily can generally
skip the manifest requirement, but are encouraged to verify with Canada
Post. If a contract customer doesn't close out a shipment day by creating
a manifest, Canada Post may bill for & transmit the shipments on customer's
behalf.

I<Note: You can't refund shipments after they have been closed-out.>
