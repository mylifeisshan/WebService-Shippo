=head1 NAME

WebService::Shippo::Shipment - Shipment collection class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

At the heart of the Shippo API is the Shipment object. It is made up
of sender and recipient addresses, details of the parcel to be shipped
and, for international shipments, the customs declaration. Once created,
a Shipment object can be used to retrieve shipping rates and purchase a
shipping label.
