=head1 NAME

WebService::Shippo::Transaction - Transaction collection class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Transaction is the purchase of a shipment label for a given shipment
rate. Transactions can be as simple as posting a rate identifier, but
also allow you to define further label parameters, such as pickup and
notifications.

Transactions can only be created for rates that are less than 7 days
old and whose C<object_purpose> attribute is B<PURCHASE>.

Transactions are created asynchronously. The response time depends
exclusively on the carrier's server.

=head1 API DOCUMENTATION

For more information about Transactions, consult the Shippo API
documentation:
