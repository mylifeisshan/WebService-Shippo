=head1 NAME

WebService::Shippo::Rate - Rate class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each valid Shipment object will automatically trigger the calculation
of all available rates. Depending on the state of the shipment's address
and parcel elements, there may be none, one or multiple rates.

By default, the calculated rates will returned in two currencies:

=over 2

=item * The C<amount> attribute will contain the rate expressed in the
currency that is used in the country from which the parcel originates.

=item * The C<amount_local> attribute will contain the rate expressed
in the currency that is used in the country to which the parcel is being
shipped. 

=back 

You can request rates expressed in a different currency. The full list
of supported currencies, along with their codes, can be viewed on
L<open exchange rates|http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json>.

Re-requesting the rates with a different currency code will
re-queue the shipment, setting the Shipment object's C<object_status>
attribute to B<QUEUED>; the converted currency rates will only be
available once that attribute has been set to B<SUCCESS>.

Rates are created asynchronously. The response time depends exclusively
on the carrier's server.
