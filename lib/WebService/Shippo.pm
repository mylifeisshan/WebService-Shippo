=head1 UNDER CONSTRUCTION

B<Though functional, this software is still in the process of being
documented and should, therefore, be considered a work in progress.> 

=head1 NAME

WebService::Shippo - Shippo API Client

=head1 SYNOPIS

B<Note>: though scripts and modules must always C<use WebService::Shippo;>
to import the client software, the C<WebService::> portion of that package
namespace may be dropped when subsequently referring to the main package
or any of its resource classes. For example, C<WebService::Shippo::Address>
and C<Shippo::Address> refer to the same class. 

To compel the developer to continue using the C<WebService::> prefix does
seem like an unreasonable form of torture, besides which, it probably
doesn't leave much scope for indenting code as some class names would be
very long. Use it, or don't use it. It's entirely up to you.

The sample code in this synopsis produced the following label:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shippo connects you with multiple shipping providers (USPS, UPS and Fedex,
for example) through one interface, offering you great discounts on a
selection of shipping rates. You can sign-up for an account at 
L<https://goshippo.com/>.

The Shippo API can be used to automate and customize shipping capabilities
for your e-commerce store or marketplace, enabling you to retrieve shipping 
rates, create and purchase shipping labels, track packages, and much more.

Though Shippo I<do> offer official API clients for a bevy of major languages, 
the venerable Perl 5 was not included in that list. This community offering 
attempts to correct that omission ;-)

=head2 API Resources

Access to all Shippo API resources is via URLs relative to the same encrypted
API endpoint (https://api.goshippo.com/v1/). The client provides object and
collection classes to help with the nitty-gritty of dealing with those
resources:

=over 2

=item * L<Addresses|WebService::Shippo::Address>

=item * L<Parcels|WebService::Shippo::Parcel>

=item * L<Shipments|WebService::Shippo::Shipment>

=item * L<Rates|WebService::Shippo::Rate>

=item * L<Transactions|WebService::Shippo::Transaction>

=item * L<Customs Items|WebService::Shippo::CustomsItem>

=item * L<Customs Declarations|WebService::Shippo::CustomsDeclaration>

=item * L<Refunds|WebService::Shippo::Refund>

=item * L<Manifests|WebService::Shippo::Manifest>

=item * L<Carrier Accounts|WebService::Shippo::CarrierAccount>

=back

Each item class has a related collection class with a similar name I<in the
plural form>. The rationale behind this is that the Shippo API can be used
to retrieve single objects with the C<fetch> method, and collections of
objects with the C<all> method, and different behaviours may be applied
to collections, which is why both forms exist.

=head2 Request & Response Data

The Perl client ensures that requests are properly encoded and passed to the
correct API endpoints using appropriate HTTP methods. There is documentation
for each API resource, containing more details on the values accepted by and
returned for a given resource (see L<FULL API DOCUMENTATION>).

All API requests return responses encoded as JSON strings, which the client
converts into Perl blessed object references of the correct type. As a rule,
any resource attribute documented in the API specification will have an
accessor of the same same in a Perl instance of that object.

=head2 REST & Disposable Objects

The Shippo API is built with simplicity and RESTful principles in mind:
B<POST> requests are used to create objects, B<GET> requests to fetch and
list objects, and B<PUT> requests to update objects. The Perl client provides
C<create>, C<fetch>, C<all> and C<update> methods for use with resource
objects that permit such operations.

Addresses, Parcels, Shipments, Rates, Transactions, Refunds, Customs Items and
Customs Declarations are disposable objects. This means that once you create
an object, you cannot change it. Instead, create a new one with the desired
values. Carrier Accounts are the exception and may be updated via B<PUT>
requests.

=head1 OBJECTS vs COLLECTIONS

Whereas a GET request to L<https://api.goshippo.com/v1/addresses/d799c2679e644279b59fe661ac8fa488>
might produce a single address whose structure would resemble this:

    {
       "object_state":"VALID",
       "object_purpose":"PURCHASE",
       "object_source":"FULLY_ENTERED",
       "object_created":"2014-07-09T02:19:13.174Z",
       "object_updated":"2014-07-09T02:19:13.174Z",
       "object_id":"d799c2679e644279b59fe661ac8fa488",
       "object_owner":"shippotle@goshippo.com",
       "name":"Shawn Ippotle",
       "street1":"215 Clayton St.",
       "street2":"",
       "city":"San Francisco",
       "state":"CA",
       "zip":"94117",
       "country":"US",
       "phone":"15553419393",
       "email":"shippotle@goshippo.com",
       "ip":null,
       "is_residential":true,
       "messages":[],
       "metadata":"Customer ID 123456"
    }

A GET request to L<https://api.goshippo.com/v1/addresses/> might produce a
collection of address objects whose structure would resemble this:

    {
       "count":3,
       "next":null,
       "previous":null,
       "results":[
          {
             "object_state":"VALID",
             "object_purpose":"PURCHASE",
             "object_source":"FULLY_ENTERED",
             "object_created":"2014-07-16T23:20:31.089Z",
             "object_updated":"2014-07-16T23:20:31.089Z",
             "object_id":"747207de2ba64443b645d08388d0309c",
             "object_owner":"shippotle@goshippo.com",
             "name":"Shawn Ippotle",
             "street1":"215 Clayton St.",
             "street2":"",
             "city":"San Francisco",
             "state":"CA",
             "zip":"94117",
             "country":"US",
             "phone":"15553419393",
             "email":"shippotle@goshippo.com",
             "is_residential":true,
             "ip":null,
             "messages":[
    
             ],
             "metadata":"Customer ID 123456"
          },
          {...},
          {...}
       ]
    }

The Shippo API does not distinguish between a single object and a collection
of objects. It deals purely with JSON strings and both object and collection
are notionally considered to be the same type of object.

Nevertheless, the Perl client B<does> distinguish between a single object and
a collection of objects. For each API resource, the client defines an I<Item
Class> (e.g. C<L<WebService::Shippo::Address>>) and a corresponding
I<Collection Class> (e.g. C<L<WebService::Shippo::Addresses>>). The name of
the collection class is always the plural form of the item class. Furthermore,
any objects making up the C<results> of a collection will be blessed as 
instances of the appropriate item class.

Both item and collection classes implement different interfaces, but they
also exhibit common behaviours. Collection classes will respond to methods
that aid item access and cursor navigation, while both types of class respond
(where appropriate) to C<create>, C<update>, C<fetch>, C<all>, C<iterate> and
C<collect> methods.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 api_key

Get or set the key used by API requests for Shippo's token-based
authentication. This is Shippo's preferred method of authentication.

=over 2

=item * Return the token currently being used for authentication.

    my $api_key = Shippo->api_key;

=item * Set the token to be used for authentication.
    
    Shippo->api_key($auth_token);

The C<api_key> method is chainable when used as a setter.

=back

=head2 api_credentials

Get or set the login credentials used by API requests for Shippo's legacy
authentication. Legacy authentication means encoding the HTTP Authorization
header for Basic Authentication so, even though requests and repsonses are
encrypted, you should still consider using the token-based authentication
instead (see C<api_key>). 

=over 2

=item * Return the login credentials currently being used for authentication.

    my ($username, $password) = Shippo->api_credentials;

=item * Set the credentials to be used for authentication.

    Shippo->api_credentials($username, $password);

The C<api_credentials> method is chainable when used as a setter.

=back

Whenever a configuration specifies both token and login credentials, the
client will always favour token-based authentication. If C<api_key> and
C<api_credentials> are both set manually then it is the most recently
set mechanism that defines the HTTP Authorization header.

=head1 EXPORTS

The C<WebService::Shippo> package exports a number of helpful subroutines by
default:

=head2 true

    my $fedex_account = Shippo::CarrierAccount->create(
        carrier    => 'fedex',
        account_id => '<YOUR-FEDEX-ACCOUNT-NUMBER>',
        parameters => { meter => '<YOUR-FEDEX-METER-NUMBER>' },
        test       => true,
        active     => true
    );

Returns a scalar value which will evaluate to true. 

Since the I<lingua franca> connecting Shippo's API and the Perl client is
JSON, it can feel more natural to think in those terms. Thus, C<true> may be
used in place of C<1>. Now, when creating a new object from a JSON example,
any literal and accidental use of C<true> or C<false> is much less likely
to result in misery.

See Ingy's L<boolean> package for more guidance.

=head2 false

    my $fedex_account = Shippo::CarrierAccount->create(
        carrier    => 'fedex',
        account_id => '<YOUR-FEDEX-ACCOUNT-NUMBER>',
        parameters => { meter => '<YOUR-FEDEX-METER-NUMBER>' },
        test       => false,
        active     => false
    );

Returns a scalar value which will evaluate to false. 

Since the I<lingua franca> connecting Shippo's API and the Perl client is
JSON, it can feel more natural to think in those terms. Thus, C<false> may be
used in place of C<0>. Now, when creating a new object from a JSON example,
any literal and accidental use of C<true> or C<false> is much less likely
to result in misery.

See Ingy's L<boolean> package for more guidance.

=head2 boolean

    my $bool = boolean($value);

Casts a scalar value to a boolean value (C<true> or C<false>).

See Ingy's L<boolean> package for more guidance.

=head2 callback

    $put_all_accounts_in_test_mode = Shippo::CarrierAccounts->collect( 
        callback { shift->enable_test_mode } );
    $put_all_accounts_in_test_mode->();
    
Many of the Perl client's methods allow the use of lambda functions for
block operations and filtration.

See L<Params::Callbacks> for more guidance.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

While the client does provide C<api_key> and C<api_credentials> methods to
help with authentication, hard-coding such calls in anything more mission 
critical than a simple test script may I<not> be the best way to go.

As soon as it is imported, one of the first things the client does is search
a number of locations for a L<YAML-encoded|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>
configuration file. The first one it finds is loaded.

In order, the locations searched are as follows:

=over 2

=item * C<./.shipporc>

=item * C</I<path>/I<to>/I<home>/.shipporc>

=item * C</I<etc>/shipporc>

=item * C</I<path>/I<to>/I<perl>/I<module>/I<install>/I<lib>/WebService/Shippo/Config.yml>

=back

The configuration file is very simple and needs to have the following
structure, though not all elements are mandatory:

    ---
    username: martymcfly@pinheads.org
    password: yadayada
    private_token: f0e1d2c3b4a5968778695a4b3c2d1e0f96877869
    public_token: 96877869f0e1d2c3b4a5968778695a4b3c2d1e0f
    default_token: private_token

At a minimum, your configuration should define values for C<private_token> and
C<public_token>. These are your Shippo Private and Publishable Auth tokens,
which are found on your L<Shippo API page|https://goshippo.com/user/apikeys/>.
